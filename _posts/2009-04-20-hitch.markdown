At Hashrocket, we pair program all the time. In order to properly give credit to both programmers, we wrote a helper in the form of a gem. We called it [Hitch!](http://github.com/therubymug/hitch)

### So how does it work?

In the spirit of staying DRY, I will direct you to Les Hill's blog post: [Pairing with Hitch](http://blog.leshill.org/blog/2009/04/20/pairing-with-hitch.html)

Enjoy.
